# Lab 02 for code 201
## About Me

### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to learn more better! I will be getting familiar with user stories, git commands, and getting creative when building my site. I will be focusing on the following when building my site - 

<ol>
  <li>Incorporate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Flawless indentation and Syntax</li>
  <li>Require user input and add functions to validate the input</li>
  <li>Add descriptive console log message</li>
  <li>Frequently Add/Commit/Push to Git via the command line. Be detailed in my commit message!</li>
</ol>  

### Tools Used
  <ul>
    <li>VS Code</li>
    <li>W3 Schools Element Tester</li>
  </ul>  


### Motivation
I wanted to get creative and have a little fun with this project, rather than just pick 5 questions to ask someone about myself. I decided I wanted to be a genie who would grant one wish if the user answered questions about myself correctly. Naturally, my genie name is Breenie.

MIT - everyone is free to do whatever they would like to my project! Please don't mess it up too bad, I really like it!
